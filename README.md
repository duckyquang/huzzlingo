## AI Features

### Final Boss AI Integration

The final boss feature uses HuggingFace's AI models to create dynamic conversations:

- **Without API key**: Uses rule-based responses (still fully functional)
- **With API key**: Uses AI-powered responses for more natural conversations

The AI integration includes:
- Personality-driven responses as "Sarah" 
- Context-aware conversation analysis
- Intelligent scoring based on conversation quality
- Fallback to original behavior if AI is unavailable

### Setting up HuggingFace API

1. Visit [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
4. Create a new token with "Read" permissions
5. Add the token to your `.env.local` file

The app will automatically detect if an API key is available and enable AI features accordingly.
