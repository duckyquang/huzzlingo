# Components

This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application. Each component should be:

- **Self-contained**: Include all necessary styles and logic
- **Reusable**: Designed to be used in multiple places
- **Well-documented**: Props and usage should be clear
- **Small and focused**: Do one thing well

## Structure

Each component should have its own directory with:
- `ComponentName.tsx` - Main component file
- `index.ts` - Exports
- `README.md` - Documentation (optional)

- `Card/` - Card containers with various styles
- `Question/` - Question components for lessons
